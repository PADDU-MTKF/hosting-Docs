# 🚀 VPS Deployment Reference Guide

A **simple static documentation website** built using **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, created as a **quick-reference guide** for deploying applications to a **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**.

This project documents **real-world production deployment steps** that I regularly refer to when setting up servers and deploying applications.

---

## ✨ Features

- Step-by-step **production deployment references**
- **Linux initial server setup** checklist
- VPS security and best practices
- Deployment guides for multiple frameworks
- Common Linux commands for quick access
- Fully **static site** (no backend, no database)
- Designed for **fast lookup**, not tutorials

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This site exists to:

- Act as a **personal and reusable deployment checklist**
- Avoid missing critical steps during production deployments
- Standardize VPS setup across different projects
- Serve as a **central reference** for multiple frameworks

It is **not a beginner tutorial**, but a **practical deployment reference**.

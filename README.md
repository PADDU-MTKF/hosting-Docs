# 🚀 VPS Deployment Reference Guide

A **simple static documentation website** built using **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, created as a **quick-reference guide** for deploying applications to a **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**.

This project documents **real-world production deployment steps** that I regularly refer to when setting up servers and deploying applications.
